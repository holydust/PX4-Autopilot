Dear PX4 Hardware Evaluation Team, 
I am writing to introduce our company, Shenzhen Feikong Technology Co., Ltd., based in Shenzhen, China. We specialize in developing hardware components for Drones under our brand name, CORVON. Our product line includes flight controllers, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), GPS modules, and optical flow ToF sensors, all designed to be compatible with PX4 firmware.
We are eager to collaborate with the PX4 community to ensure seamless integration of our products and to have our brand included in the official list of supported hardware. To achieve this, we would appreciate guidance on the necessary steps and requirements for contributing to the PX4 project.
Looking forward to contributing to the PX4 ecosystem.
Best regards
Vince Xu
